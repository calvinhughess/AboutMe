# AboutMe
From the vibrant classrooms at the University of Maryland to the virtual realms of Rocket League, my journey in the world of computer science has been both fulfilling and transformative. While my high school years, marked by a stellar GPA of 4.67, laid the foundational stones of my academic aspirations, it is in the sprawling campus of Maryland that I truly began to harness my potential.

In the realm of programming, I've been fortunate enough to acquaint myself with languages like C/C++, Java, and Python. Tools such as Git/GitHub, Unix Shell, and VS Code have become second nature to me. But beyond the code and algorithms, what truly drives me is the real-world application of these skills. My work on the Rocket League Ball & Car Tracker is something I cherish. Through OpenCV's prowess, I ventured into uncharted territories, aligning virtual cars to balls and enhancing the gameplay experience to a point where my system could outperform human reflexes. This insatiable desire to innovate continued as I designed a custom Unix shell and a memory-efficient dynamic calendar management system.

Parallel to these technical pursuits, I embarked on a digital odyssey by establishing my YouTube channel. Here, I have had the privilege to connect with over 110,000 subscribers, sharing my passion for Rocket League, teaching strategies, and offering tutorials. Engaging with this vast online community and seeing the tangible impact of my content has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.

Yet, beyond codes, algorithms, and digital platforms, there's a part of my identity that profoundly shapes who I am: my deep-rooted connection to the deaf community. Having deaf parents, I grew up immersed in a world where conversations flowed seamlessly without spoken words. This exposure to the deaf culture gifted me not just with fluency in American Sign Language, but also with invaluable lessons on empathy, patience, and the beauty of silent expressions. It taught me to appreciate the richness of diverse forms of communication and to bridge gaps that often go unnoticed.

In tandem with my academic and online endeavors, I've also ventured into leadership roles, serving as the Vice-President of Social Relations for Sigma Phi Delta Engineering Fraternity at Maryland. Orchestrating events, driving community engagement, and steering the fraternity's strategic direction has been both challenging and enlightening.

At the crossroads of technology and deaf culture, my story is one of passion, perseverance, and purpose. It's about celebrating diversity, driving innovation, and constantly seeking intersections where I can make a difference.
