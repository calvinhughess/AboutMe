# AboutMe
Navigating the world of computer science, from the energetic classrooms of the University of Maryland to the exhilarating arenas of Rocket League, has been an incredible journey for me. In high school, I was a dedicated student with a 4.67 GPA, but it wasn’t until I stepped onto Maryland's campus that my capabilities truly began to flourish.

I’ve honed my skills in C/C++, Java, and Python, and tools like Git/GitHub, Unix Shell, and VS Code are now extensions of my thought process. However, what really excites me is applying this knowledge. I'm particularly proud of the AI-Controlled Rocket League Interface I developed using OpenCV. It blended two of my favorite pastimes, coding and gaming, into a project I spent weeks working on and perfecting. 

But I'm not just a coder. My YouTube channel, boasting 110,000 subscribers, is my digital haven where I share my fervor for gaming and education. Interacting with this global community and witnessing the direct impact of my work has been profoundly rewarding.

Still, there’s an intimate part of my journey deeply woven into my identity - my ties to the deaf community. Born to deaf parents, American Sign Language was my first language, and the silent, expressive world of deaf culture my first home. It’s imbued in me a depth of empathy and a nuanced understanding of communication that I hold dear.

I've also dipped my toes in leadership, serving as Vice-President of Social Relations for Sigma Phi Delta Engineering Fraternity. This role, a mix of challenges and revelations, has amplified my journey, painting it with diverse hues of learning and growth.

As I weave through the tapestry of technology, deaf culture, and leadership, my narrative is stitched with threads of passion and purpose. It's a tale less about codes and algorithms, and more about human connections, bridging gaps, and creating spaces where diversity and innovation thrive together. Each experience is a stitch, crafting a story that is as multifaceted as it is deeply personal.
